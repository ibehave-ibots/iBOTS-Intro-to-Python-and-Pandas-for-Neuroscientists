    "Seaborn is a statistical plotting tool, so it gives you control over which statistics you want to plot!  To change which statistic (called an **\"estimate\"** by Seaborn) is used, set the **`estimator`** parameter to what you need.  Some common estimators like mean, median, and std are already built-in, so you can just write them as a string, but Seaborn will accept any statistics function you'd like it to use:\n",
